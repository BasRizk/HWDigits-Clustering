Determinining which of the 30 outputs is the best clustering result.

=> After each of the converges is over.

=> an array is calculated based on the prior knowledge of the classes of the data,
and the k-means computed clusters.

- An array is computed for each convergance observing the counts from each
 cluster with the prior knowledge of each class from each digit of our
 data-set (for example digit-0) considering its maximum count cluster,
 (for example clustered in cluster-a with 25 samples, and cluster-b with 150,
 then cluster-b is chosen as the dominating cluster for the class)

- the sum of the values of each array -just computed- then reflects the amount
 of data clustered correctly; hence, the convergance corresponding to
 the computed-array with the maximum sum is the best performing convergance,
 or in other words, most accurately clustering our original classes.
